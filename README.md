# Calc

An calculation package to calculate big digits, using BigInteger and BigDecimal.

The class use both class and do calcs internal the the number itself, even the calculaion methods have a return, the object save internaly the value.

The class have too an Matrix Calculation, that can calulate summations, abstractions, multiplication of Matrix.

Important: Matrix Index start at 1

## Progress:
- [x] Numeral - BigInteger Adaptation
- [x] BigDecimal Adaptation
- [ ] Matrix Sumattions
- [ ] Matrix Abstraction
- [x] Matrix - Matrix Multiplication
- [x] Matrix - Number Multiplication
